# My Archlinux rice (forked from a certain voidrice...)

These dotfiles are currently a work in progress. I want to keep some aspects of Luke's philsosphy but take one step or two in the direction of bloat.

Luke's configs are great but could be more in line with some of the linux desktop standards (such as a system tray?). I also see my attempt to change Luke's configs as an opportunity to remove the support wheels and force myself to actually learn a bit of the inner workings in an usable arch system.

Alongside learning the workings of my arch system I will also need to learn the technologies that I as a future developer will need. These technologies will need their own setup that might be included in this rice.

### My goals
- Create a system which will be an extension of my mind in whatever creative endavours I wish to engage in.
- Create a well functioning development environment.
	- NeoVim with some plugins. Will be a separate repositry. With language server support I will have most of my needs met.
	- Some system to handle dependencies (looking at you haskel). I want to separate the dependencies of whatever I'm developing and programs that have a "permanent" home in my system.
- Create a system for writing that allows me to quickly write down an idea and later transform this into a page for my static site.
- Create a way to navigate the system with ease.
	- direct access to fuzy finder with binding.
- Create documentation along the way that will aid the newb soydev arclinux "user" in his (or her) journey to become a gigachad bigbrain ricer and configurator.
- Give the system an apperance that is functional and in alignment with whatever design principles governs how "usable" my system is. If I am to make something suitable for r/unixporn it won't be something were everything for some reason is blue, with horrible contrast.

###Programs

AwesomeWM
- At some level, features and stability is more important than a small codebase. I've used Luke's DWM build but finds certain things like global layouts instead of per tag layouts tedious. I know that I could make a fork and squirt in some patches but I would prefer having a WM that at stock is actually usable.
      
### Current remenants from original voidrice
There are certain artefacts from Luke's rice that have remained. Either I have found them to be usefull for my usecase (or I have simply not found them), or I have just not found a reason to remove them.
